  Crew allocation problem  in OR-tools CP-SAT Solver.

  From Gecode example crew
  examples/crew.cc
  '''
  * Example: Airline crew allocation
  *
  * Assign 20 flight attendants to 10 flights. Each flight needs a certain
  * number of cabin crew, and they have to speak certain languages.
  * Every cabin crew member has two flights off after an attended flight.
  *
